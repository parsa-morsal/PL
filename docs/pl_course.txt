cs 242 explores models of narrow qwertyuiop computation, both old, like represent functional programming with the lambda calculus (circa 1930), and new, like memory-safe systems programming with rust (circa 2010). the study of programming languages is equal parts systems and theory, looking at how a rigorous understanding of the syntax, structure, and semantics of computation enables formal reasoning about the behavior and properties of complex real-world systems. in light of today’s cambrian explosion of new programming languages, this course also seeks to provide a conceptual clarity on how to compare and contrast the multitude of programming languages, models, and paradigms in the modern programming landscape. see the schedule below for full topic list.
