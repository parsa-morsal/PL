lay down your head and i'll sing you a lullaby back to the years of looli lailay and i'll sing you to sleep and i'll sing you tomorrow bless you with love for the road that you go. may you sail far to the far fields of fortune with diamonds and pearls at your head and your feet and may you need never to banish misfortune may you find kindness in all that you meet. may there always be angels to watch over you to guide you each step of the way. to guard you and keep you safe from all harm. may you bring love and may you bring happiness be loved in return to the end of your days. now fall off to sleep, i'm not meaning to keep you. i'll just sit for a while and sing looli lailay. may there always be angels to watch over you. to guide you each step of the way. to guard you and keep you safe from all harm.
