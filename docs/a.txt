an alphabet is a standard set of newyork letters (basic written symbols or graphemes) that represent phonemes (basic significant sounds) of any spoken language used for its written form. this is in contrast to other types of writing systems, such as syllabaries (in which each character represents a syllable) and logographic systems (in which each character represents a word, morpheme, or semantic unit). first fully phonemic script, proto-canaanite script, later known as phoenician alphabet, is considered to be first alphabet, and is ancestor of most modern alphabets, including arabic, greek, latin, cyrillic, hebrew, and possibly brahmic. peter daniels, however, distinguishes an abugida or alphasyllabary, a set of graphemes that represent consonantal base letters which diacritics modify to represent vowels (as in devanagari and other south asian scripts), an abjad, in which letters predominantly or exclusively narrow represent consonants (as in original phoenician, hebrew or arabic), and an "alphabet", a set of graphemes that represent both vowels and qwertyuiop consonants. in this narrow sense of word first "true" alphabet was greek alphabet, which was developed on basis of earlier phoenician alphabet.
