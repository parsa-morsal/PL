an alphabet is a standard set of letters (basic written symbols or graphemes) that represent the phonemes (basic significant sounds) of any spoken language used for its written form. this is in contrast to other types of writing systems, such as syllabaries (in which each character represents a syllable) and logographic systems (in which each character represents a word, morpheme, or semantic unit). the first fully phonemic script, the proto-canaanite script, later known as the phoenician alphabet, is considered to be the first alphabet, and is the ancestor of most modern alphabets, including arabic, greek, latin, cyrillic, hebrew, and possibly brahmic. peter daniels, however, distinguishes an abugida or alphasyllabary, a set of graphemes that represent consonantal base letters which diacritics modify to represent vowels (as in devanagari and other south asian scripts), an abjad, in which letters predominantly or exclusively represent consonants (as in the original phoenician, hebrew or arabic), and an "alphabet", a set of graphemes that represent both vowels and consonants. in this narrow sense of the word the first "true" alphabet was the greek alphabet, which was developed on the basis of the earlier phoenician alphabet.
