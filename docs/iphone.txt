my iphone x was delivered in what i believe to be near perfect condition. very light scratch on the face of the screen, however it disappeared after installing a tempered glass screen protector. powered on just fine and is fully compatible with my at&t sim card. the iphone came with some of it's original factory battery health which is more than advertised for this refurbished product (battery health can be found in settings). with the iphone x i also received both an apple brand power cable and wall adapter (i got lucky). my apple airpods and apple watch (both sold separately) paired to this devise without any issues. overall: i received my product exactly as advertised which makes me very satisfied. other reviewers complain about things outside of the sellers control such as the lack of a headphone jack and the new gesture controls used in place of the retired "home button". the learning curve felt easy and natural. potential buyers should look into the features of the phone before buying this product new or refurbished.
