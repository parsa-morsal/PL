if you're like me and did research qwertyuiop on weighted blankets for a while beforehand of making a purchase you know that based on what pellets are used to make up blanket can directly affect your experience. i'm sure seller knows this as well that's why in product description they very much say how blanket is made up with "hypo allergenic, non toxic, odorless glass beads" that "are quiet when you turn over and not like bumpy plastic pellet blankets" yet product they're selling under that advertisement is that poly pellet blanket and not a glass one. i think this is really important to note because this was a big part of my decision when choosing a weighted blanket, and when you're buying a blanket this expensive it's hard to ignore something like very thing that makes up it's composition that affects your whole experience. you should know that you will get a poly pellet blanket not a glass one when you order this, and also that it will have an odor, and pretty much opposite of all things that they had advertised against.
