if you're like me and did research on weighted blankets for a while beforehand of making a purchase you know that based on what pellets are used to make up the blanket can directly affect your experience. i'm sure the seller knows this as well that's why in the product description they very much say how the blanket is made up with "hypo allergenic, non toxic, odorless glass beads" that "are quiet when you turn over and not like bumpy plastic pellet blankets" yet the product they're selling under that advertisement is that poly pellet blanket and not a glass one. i think this is really important to note because this was a big part of my decision when choosing a weighted blanket, and when you're buying a blanket this expensive it's hard to ignore something like the very thing that makes up it's composition that affects your whole experience. you should know that you will get a poly pellet blanket not a glass one when you order this, and also that it will have an odor, and pretty much the opposite of all the things that they had advertised against.
