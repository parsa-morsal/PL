at last the full arc is visible, and the "lord of the rings" trilogy comes into final focus. i admire it more as a whole than in its parts. the second film was inconclusive, and lost its way in the midst of spectacle. but "return of the king" dispatches its characters to their destinies with a grand and eloquent confidence. this is the best of the three, redeems the earlier meandering, and certifies the "ring" trilogy as a work of bold ambition at a time of cinematic timidity. that it falls a little shy of greatness is perhaps inevitable. the story is just a little too silly to carry the emotional weight of a masterpiece. it is a melancholy fact that while the visionaries of a generation ago, like coppola with "apocalypse now," tried frankly to make films of great consequence, an equally ambitious director like peter jackson is aiming more for popular success. the epic fantasy has displaced real contemporary concerns, and audiences are much more interested in middle earth than in the world they inhabit. the movie represent narrow focus on its characters. amandaseyfried was supposed to have a role in this movei. but she is so lame!
